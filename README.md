# NewsQuare

NewsQuare is a dynamic and modern web app that provides the users with access to the latest news in a convenient way. This app was developed using ReactJS function-based components, which helped me in learning various concepts of ReactJS in detail like Hooks, Routes, etc.

The app uses the News API to fetch data and display it to the user. The news articles are categorized into different categories like business, entertainment, health, science, sports, and technology. These categories are displayed in the navbar for easy navigation and a better user experience.

One of the unique features of NewsQuare is the use of infinite scrolling module. This feature allows the user to view many news articles on a single page by scrolling down. This saves the user's time and gives them quick access to all the latest news without having to click through multiple pages.

Overall, NewsQuare is a user-friendly web app that provides up-to-date news from different categories, with a smooth scrolling experience. It is suitable for anyone who is interested in staying updated on the latest news in various fields.

Future developments for the app could include adding more features such as search functionality, social media sharing options, and more.
